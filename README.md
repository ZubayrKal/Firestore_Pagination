# Firestore_Pagination
Some pagination works with firestore.
Hey Coders!
This is a really simple project for me to try with pagination with Firestore. (Maybe in near future I will increase the complexity and push here)
As I said, it is simple now. I havent tried much on bug fixing or events like when there is no texts in edittexts etc (so please dont just leave the edittexts empty!)
In MainActivity you can add, load, update your posts.
The "ONE NEXT" Button goes to Main2Activity and "OTHER NEXT" goes to Main3Activity
In Main2Activity you can fetch the posts in a simplier fashion of pagination.
In Main3Activity you can use pagination with recyclerview.
